# Project-Restaurant-Page

## Project Overview  
This project was built entirely using DOM manipulation without relying on external frameworks. Through this project, I learned about Webpack and how to efficiently bundle JavaScript modules. Additionally, the frontend design was fully developed by me, focusing on a clean and responsive UI.  

## Features  
- **Modular Structure:** Home, Contact, and About sections are separated into individual JavaScript files for better maintainability.  
- **Responsive UI:** Designed a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.  
- **Efficient Webpack Setup:** Implemented Webpack for optimized bundling and code management.  
- **Dynamic Content Rendering:** Page content updates dynamically without reloading the page.
